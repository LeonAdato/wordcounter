# WordCounter Readme

## Description
WordCounter is a (very) simple utility that, as the name implies, counts words.

## Installation
On the system where you want to run this, make sure you have both tkinter and customtkinter installed. 

  - tkinter should be automatically included when you install python. But if it's not, you can find information on installing it here: [https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)
  - instructions on installing customtkinter can be found here: [https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/documentation/](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/documentation/)

## Usage
 - launch the utility by running `python3 wordcount.py`
  - to launch the utility and return to the command line, add an ampersand (\&) at the end. i.e. `python3 wordcount.py &`
 - to count words, copy them to the clipboard (highlight and then hit ctrl/cmd-C (or Edit-Copy) on most systems). Then click the "count words" button in the utility
 - to exit, click the exit button.
